The ability to architect scalable, secure, and cost-effective solutions that can transform businesses fascinates me. My goal is to master the technical depths of cloud infrastructure while developing the strategic thinking required to design solutions that truly solve real-world problems. This passion drives my commitment to continuous learning and my determination to contribute meaningfully to the cloud ecosystem.

## 🚀 About Me

### Background

My professional background is in administrative work, where I developed strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work efficiently under pressure. While my experience was non-technical, I've always been curious about technology and how things work behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to take the leap into cloud computing!

I'm naturally hardworking, honest, and kind. I believe in giving my best to everything I do, and I'm committed to continuous learning and growth. My journey into cloud computing represents a deliberate career pivot toward technology. What sets me apart is my approach to learning—I don't just aim to understand how services work, but why certain architectural decisions matter. I'm building my expertise with a user-centric mindset, always considering how technical solutions translate into business value and improved user experiences.

### AWS re/Start Journey

I recently completed the AWS re/Start program, an intensive training experience that equipped me with foundational cloud computing skills. Through this program, I gained:

- Practical knowledge of core AWS services and their real-world applications
- Understanding of cloud security, cost management, and operational best practices
- Hands-on experience with cloud problem-solving and architecture design
- Professional development in technical communication, teamwork, and presenting solutions

This comprehensive training provided me with both the technical skills and practical mindset needed to work effectively in cloud environments. I'm now seeking an entry-level cloud role where I can apply what I've learned, contribute to meaningful projects, and develop the expertise required to advance toward a Cloud Solutions Architect position.

## 🎯 Career Goals

**Short-term:** I'm seeking opportunities as a Cloud Support Specialist or Junior Cloud Engineer where I can apply my AWS knowledge and continue learning.

**Long-term:** My aspiration is to become an AWS Solutions Architect, helping organizations solve real-world problems through cloud technology.

**What excites me:**
- Cloud infrastructure and architecture
- Security and best practices
- Automation and efficiency
- Helping businesses migrate to the cloud

## 📂 Featured Project

## Project 1. Static Website Hosting on AWS

This project demonstrates the migration of a static website to AWS cloud infrastructure, showcasing how modern web content can be delivered globally with high performance, security, and cost-efficiency. The objective was to architect a complete hosting solution using AWS managed services, implementing industry best practices for static content delivery.

**What we Built:**

A fully functional static website hosted entirely on AWS, featuring:
- Secure HTTPS delivery with SSL/TLS encryption
- Global content distribution for optimal load times
- Custom domain configuration with professional DNS management
- Cost-optimized architecture using AWS Free Tier services

## Some of the AWS Services Utilized:**

- **Amazon S3** – Object storage configured for static website hosting with properly secured bucket policies
- **Amazon CloudFront** – Content Delivery Network (CDN) for caching and accelerated global content delivery
- **AWS Route 53** – DNS service for custom domain routing and traffic management
- **AWS Certificate Manager** – Free SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections

**Technical Implementation:**

This project required me to understand how multiple AWS services integrate to create a cohesive solution. We configured an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled, ensuring proper public access permissions while maintaining security best practices. We then created a CloudFront distribution to serve content from multiple edge locations worldwide, significantly reducing latency for global users.

The integration of Route 53 allowed me to configure a custom domain with proper DNS records, while Certificate Manager provided SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS—a critical requirement for modern web security. We configured origin access identity to ensure CloudFront could access S3 content while keeping the bucket itself private, demonstrating the security principle of least privilege.

## Project 2. Design a 3D E-Commerce Platform Architecture on AWS

The cloud architecture for the 3D e-commerce platform is designed using AWS managed services to ensure high availability, scalability, performance, security, and cost efficiency. The system uses a globally distributed content delivery layer, scalable compute resources, secure data stores, and automated monitoring tool

## What we did
This project was a group effort completed alongside my fellow team members. We worked together to plan the architecture, choose the AWS services, and create all diagrams and documentation.

## Some of the AWS Services Utilized:**

- Amazon S3 for 3D asset storage
- CloudFront for content delivery
- EC2 / AWS Lambda for backend compute
- RDS / DynamoDB for product and customer data
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution
- Route 53 for domain management
- CloudWatch & Trusted Advisor for monitoring and optimization

## Technical Implementation

For this project, our team integrated several AWS services to build a scalable and efficient 3D e-commerce architecture. We used Amazon S3 to store 3D assets securely, paired with CloudFront to deliver content globally with low latency. Route 53 was configured for domain management, while Certificate Manager handled SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure HTTPS access.

We implemented EC2 with Auto Scaling (or Lambda for lighter workloads) behind an Elastic Load Balancer to support backend processing and handle traffic spikes. RDS or DynamoDB provided reliable, multi-AZ database storage. CloudWatch and Trusted Advisor were used to monitor performance, optimize cost, and reinforce best security practices across the environment.
