## 📂 Featured Project

## Project 1. Static Website Hosting on AWS

This project demonstrates the migration of a static website to AWS cloud infrastructure, showcasing how modern web content can be delivered globally with high performance, security, and cost-efficiency. The objective was to architect a complete hosting solution using AWS managed services, implementing industry best practices for static content delivery.

**What we Built:**

A fully functional static website hosted entirely on AWS, featuring:
- Secure HTTPS delivery with SSL/TLS encryption
- Global content distribution for optimal load times
- Custom domain configuration with professional DNS management
- Cost-optimized architecture using AWS Free Tier services

## Some of the AWS Services Utilized:**

- **Amazon S3** – Object storage configured for static website hosting with properly secured bucket policies
- **Amazon CloudFront** – Content Delivery Network (CDN) for caching and accelerated global content delivery
- **AWS Route 53** – DNS service for custom domain routing and traffic management
- **AWS Certificate Manager** – Free SSL/TLS certificates for secure HTTPS connections

**Technical Implementation:**

This project required me to understand how multiple AWS services integrate to create a cohesive solution. We configured an S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled, ensuring proper public access permissions while maintaining security best practices. We then created a CloudFront distribution to serve content from multiple edge locations worldwide, significantly reducing latency for global users.

The integration of Route 53 allowed me to configure a custom domain with proper DNS records, while Certificate Manager provided SSL/TLS certificates to enable HTTPS—a critical requirement for modern web security. We configured origin access identity to ensure CloudFront could access S3 content while keeping the bucket itself private, demonstrating the security principle of least privilege.

## Project 2. Design a 3D E-Commerce Platform Architecture on AWS

The cloud architecture for the 3D e-commerce platform is designed using AWS managed services to ensure high availability, scalability, performance, security, and cost efficiency. The system uses a globally distributed content delivery layer, scalable compute resources, secure data stores, and automated monitoring tool

## What we did
This project was a group effort completed alongside my fellow team members. We worked together to plan the architecture, choose the AWS services, and create all diagrams and documentation.

## Some of the AWS Services Utilized:**

- Amazon S3 for 3D asset storage
- CloudFront for content delivery
- EC2 / AWS Lambda for backend compute
- RDS / DynamoDB for product and customer data
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution
- Route 53 for domain management
- CloudWatch & Trusted Advisor for monitoring and optimization

## Technical Implementation

For this project, our team integrated several AWS services to build a scalable and efficient 3D e-commerce architecture. We used Amazon S3 to store 3D assets securely, paired with CloudFront to deliver content globally with low latency. Route 53 was configured for domain management, while Certificate Manager handled SSL/TLS certificates to ensure secure HTTPS access.

We implemented EC2 with Auto Scaling (or Lambda for lighter workloads) behind an Elastic Load Balancer to support backend processing and handle traffic spikes. RDS or DynamoDB provided reliable, multi-AZ database storage. CloudWatch and Trusted Advisor were used to monitor performance, optimize cost, and reinforce best security practices across the environment.

# Project 4. Serverless Image Recognition Pipeline on AWS
This project demonstrates how I deployed a fully automated image recognition system on AWS. My objective was to build an event-driven pipeline that analyzes images the moment they are uploaded, using AWS artificial intelligence — with no servers to manage.

# What I Built
A serverless image recognition pipeline on AWS, featuring:

- Automatic image analysis triggered instantly on file upload
- AI-powered label detection identifying objects, people, and fine details
- Secure service communication using IAM least-privilege roles
- Real-time logging and monitoring through CloudWatch


# AWS Services I Used

- Amazon S3 – I used S3 to store uploaded images and trigger the pipeline automatically on each upload
- AWS Lambda – I wrote a Python function that runs serverlessly in response to S3 events, with no infrastructure required
- Amazon Rekognition – I connected this AWS AI service to analyze each image and return detected labels with confidence scores
- AWS IAM – I created a role that grants Lambda only the exact permissions needed to access S3, Rekognition, and CloudWatch
- Amazon CloudWatch – I used this to capture all logs, results, and execution metrics for every function run


# How I Built It
- I configured an S3 bucket to automatically invoke my Lambda function whenever a new image is uploaded. I wrote the Lambda function in Python using the boto3 SDK, which passes the image directly to Amazon Rekognition and logs the results to CloudWatch. I scoped the IAM execution role to only three policies — AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess, AmazonRekognitionFullAccess, and AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole — following the principle of least privilege throughout.
- When I tested it by uploading a portrait photograph, Rekognition returned the labels: Face, Head, Person, Photography, Portrait, Adult, Male, Man, Baby, and Earring — showing me how the AI identifies both broad categories and fine details within a single image. The function ran with a 100% success rate and zero errors.

# What I Learned

- Event-driven design — I saw firsthand how services can react automatically to uploads with no manual steps
- Serverless computing — I deployed and ran code without provisioning, patching, or managing any servers
- Security by design — I practiced building IAM roles that enforce least-privilege access across all services
- Observability — I used CloudWatch to monitor every result and metric from every invocation in real time
